## 🔧 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY THAT WORKED

### V3 Corrected Physics-Based Approach:
1. **Throat Radius Reduction**: 15% decrease (5.0e-36 → 4.25e-36 m)
   - Concentrates exotic matter more efficiently
   - Reduces total exotic matter volume requirement

2. **Aggressive Smoothing**: 40% smoothing parameter
   - Eliminates high-density peaks in stress-energy tensor
   - Reduces singular contributions to integral

3. **Minimal Redshift**: -0.001 correction
   - Avoids increasing stress-energy components
   - Maintains stability without energy penalty

4. **Focused Geometry**: Narrower transition width (1.2× throat radius)
   - Sharper, more efficient warp bubble profile
   - Minimizes exotic matter distribution volume
