# LQG POLYMER COEFFICIENT EXTRACTION - FINAL SUMMARY

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful extraction of polymer LQG metric coefficients α and β from classical-to-quantum Hamiltonian constraint analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Classical Foundation
- Started with spherically symmetric ADM variables
- Solved classical Hamiltonian constraint: R^(3) - K_x² = 0
- Found K_x(r) = M/(r(2M-r)) for Schwarzschild geometry f(r) = 1 - 2M/r

### 2. Polymer Quantization
- Applied holonomy correction: K_x → sin(μK_x)/μ
- Constructed polymer Hamiltonian constraint: R^(3) - [sin(μK_x)/μ]² = 0
- Expanded systematically in powers of μ

### 3. Coefficient Extraction
- Used metric ansatz: f(r) = 1 - 2M/r + αμ²M²/r⁴ + βμ⁴M⁴/r⁶
- Matched μ² and μ⁴ coefficients in the expanded constraint
- Extracted coefficients through symbolic computation

## Results

### Extracted Coefficients
```
α = -Mr/(6(2M-r)³)
β = Mr/(120(2M-r)⁵)
```

### Complete Metric Ansatz
```
f(r) = 1 - 2M/r + (-Mr/(6(2M-r)³)) · μ²M²/r⁴ + (Mr/(120(2M-r)⁵)) · μ⁴M⁴/r⁶ + O(μ⁶)
```

### Key Properties
1. **Divergence Structure**: Both coefficients diverge as r → 2M (Schwarzschild radius)
2. **Far-field Behavior**: Both coefficients vanish as r → ∞ 
3. **Classical Limit**: Metric reduces to Schwarzschild when μ → 0
4. **Dimensional Consistency**: All terms are dimensionless when properly scaled

### Resummation Analysis
- **β/α² ratio**: -3(2M-r)/(10Mr) = 3/(5r) - 3/(10M)
- **Structure**: Rational function suggesting potential for geometric series resummation
- **Form**: f(r) = classical + α·μ²·M²/r⁴ · [1 + (β/α²)μ² + (β/α²)²μ⁴ + ...]

## Physical Interpretation

### Quantum Corrections
- α term represents leading quantum correction at O(μ²)
- β term represents next-order correction at O(μ⁴)
- μ parameter encodes the discreteness scale of polymer quantization

### Phenomenological Implications
- Corrections become significant near the Schwarzschild radius
- Far from the black hole, classical behavior is recovered
- The divergent structure near r = 2M suggests quantum modifications of the horizon

### Numerical Evaluation (M = 1)
| r/M | α | β | β/α² |
|-----|---|---|------|
